# Dev Log

## 2024-02-16

Welcome the first entry of this dev log. This is a place where we will keep track of the development of our project, documenting our progress and all the ideas and problems we encounter along the way.

*Why build a streaming platform?*

We believe that the available platforms don't let creators be free. We want to build a platform that don't lock creators into a single platform, or don't take a big cut of their earnings. We want to build a platform that is open and less expensive.

Fork the project if you disagree with any of our decisions.
